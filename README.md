# computer_vision_malware_image

This code was created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Final Project in CS 171 in SJSU.

This experiment involved determining the malware family of binary malware files that have been converted to grayscale png images by training a 
Conventional Neural Network (CNN) using over 9000 malware images from 25 different families. We experimented with a variety of different parameters of our CNN. 
These experiments involved ways to preprocess the data, including shuffling and splitting, choosing the different types of layers, 
the number and order of these layers, as well as the number of nodes in our neural network. We also experimented with the loss functions and optimizers, 
and a combination of the above. Using a combination of the best parameter values we found after all of our experiments, 
our model produced an accuracy of 0.73, on average. The highest accuracy our model produced was 0.78, 
which we believe can be improved given more time where we can conduct further experiments.

Best Parameter Values Used: <br />
* Random shuffling using both random.shuffle before getting first 80 images & shuffling train_test_split <br />
* 70-15-15 split of training-validation-testing <br />
* 3 Convolutional layers and 2 Dense layers, 1 Dropout layer <br />
* 45 filters for the convolutional layers <br />
* 55 nodes for the first dense layers <br />
* Categorical Cross Entropy loss function with Adam optimizer <br />
* Dense softmax layer with 25 nodes <br />
